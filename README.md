# Weather-App-Android

A simple weather app using OpenWeatherMap's API

TO DO:
+make use of OpenWeatherMap's icon service to display an icon (sunny, cloudy, etc) along with the weather page '\n'
+allow the user to view all the other information (as of right now there is only real temp and "feels like" temp '\n'
+allow deleting of locations (right now the only way is to uninstall the app) '\n'
